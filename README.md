## Weirdness Calculator

This app utilizes the Giphy API by asking the user to submit a search term and "weirdness" (1-10). If the user likes the Gif, it will save into the users "Your Like Gifs" side of the page until you have selected 5.

The user will then be directed to a results page that will calculate their weirdness score.
